This would exclude negotiating directly with the landlord. If dissolution appears appropriate, we\u2019ll proceed conditionally.\n\nWe'll assess the lease to determine corporate and potential personal liability, confirm the presence of any guarantees, and outline key risks. If dissolution makes sense, we can prepare the required corporate filings and guide you through the wind-up process.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 To move forward, please complete our secure intake form: https://onleylaw.cliogrow.com/intake/ab11020c6901bdd5eef2afc09db57c39\n\nBest regards,  \nRob Onley  \nManaging Lawyer"}]}
